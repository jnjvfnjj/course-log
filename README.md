# English School CRM — Back-End Capstone Application

An enterprise-ready, beautifully architected School Management and billing REST API designed in standard Java 17 and Spring Boot 3.x. This backend showcases clean software architecture, object-oriented design patterns, SOLID principles, high-coverage JUnit testing, and database persistence.

## 🏛️ System Architecture

The application implements a classic **4-Tier layered enterprise architecture** that strictly decouples database concerns, service-layer business rules, and public JSON HTTP interfaces.

1. **Student Entity**: Represents student registers. Declares `@OneToMany` cascade associations to `Lessons` and `Transactions`.
2. **Lesson Entity**: Defines scheduled lessons with teacher names, student mapping, times, and lifecycle states (`Scheduled`, `Completed`, `Cancelled`).
3. **Transaction Entity**: Handles double-entry school accounting. Can reflect Student Tuitions (**Income**) or operating Rent/Teacher Salaries (**Expenses**).
4. **AuditLog Entity**: Central logging schema tracking mission-critical student hours modifications and state exceptions.

## 🎨 Implemented Design Patterns (Rubric Mastery)

This capstone project implements **three distinct GoF Design Patterns** to enforce loose coupling and maintainable extensions.

### 1. Strategy Pattern (Behavioral)
* **Rationale**: Tuition package prices dynamically pivot based on the student's selected pack tier (standard rate vs bulk discount vs VIP packages). Putting these switch cases directly in service layers creates rigid, un-extendable code.
* **Implementation**:
  * `PricingStrategy` (interface): Declares `calculatePrice(int hours)`.
  * `RegularPricingStrategy`: Computes standard billing rate ($25.0/hour).
  * `PackagePricingStrategy`: Applies a custom bulk package purchase 10% discount ($22.5/hour).
  * `VipGoldPricingStrategy`: Applies a premium VIP Gold tier 20% discount ($20.0/hour).
  * `PricingContext`: Orchestrates strategy context execution.

### 2. Builder Pattern (Creational)
* **Rationale**: Logging financial packages generates long printable invoices or receipts with many fields. Using standard constructors leads to telescoping parameter antimodes, which decreases readability and increases bug frequencies.
* **Implementation**:
  * `Receipt`: Features private constructors and can only be build dynamically by the static inner class `Receipt.ReceiptBuilder`. It generates standardized legal school printable receipts.

### 3. Observer Pattern (Behavioral)
* **Rationale**: Important states modification (such as hourly balance drop warnings or schedule cancellation events) require instant audit tracking and trigger automatic warnings. Coupling these directly inside services violates the **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**.
* **Implementation**:
  * Spring Boot application event system acts as the core event dispatcher.
  * When student balances fluctuate, `StudentBalanceEvent` gets published.
  * `SchoolEventListener` observes these events polymorphicly, records entries in the `AuditLog` table, and automatically triggers system warnings if hours drop below the threshold (≤ 3 hours).

## ⚙️ Non-Trivial Complex Business Functions

1. **Lesson Lifecycle Integration**:
   * Scheduling states are tracked actively. When a student's scheduled lesson is patched to `Completed` status, the application automatically triggers database queries to **deduct 1 hour** from their balance and increments `totalClasses` completed. 
   * If a completed lesson transitions into `Cancelled` status, their credit balance package hour is automatically restored.
2. **Tuition Payment and Refills**:
   * Creating an income transaction of category `Tuition` with matching `pricingTier` automatically selects the correct OOP Strategy, calculates final financial amounts, adds physical hours to the student's profile, and prints a formatted receipt via the custom Builder pattern.

## 🛡️ Best-Practice SOLID Code Quality Rules

* **Constructor-Based Dependency Injection**: In accordance with modern architectural guidelines, no field injections with `@Autowired` are used. All controllers and services utilize constructor parameters for dependencies, facilitating easy mock-testing.
* **Encapsulation Protection**: All fields are private. Model entities are never returned directly by Controller endpoints; separate `@Valid` DTO schemas are mapped manually inside the service layer.
* **Input Validation**: Hard input constraints are enforced globally using standard Bean validation annotations (`@NotBlank`, `@Min`, `@DecimalMax`, `@Email`, `@Pattern`).
* **Global Error Advice**: The `@RestControllerAdvice` class intercepts all validations, state conflicts, and resource-missing boundaries and maps them to unified JSON error payloads (`ErrorResponse`).

## 🧪 Unit Testing Setup (JUnit 5 + Mockito)

All service classes feature rich test coverage Mockito mocks.
Mockito mockmakers are configured under subclass mode to ensure seamless operation on sandboxed Java 21 containers without dynamic native attachments.

Run tests using:
```bash
gradle test
```

## 🚀 How to Execute and Run

### Ports Note
* The Spring Boot back-end is configured to run on Port `8080`.
* The integrated full-stack static preview is proxying web bundles on Port `3000`.

### Database Options
Two datasource layers are supported in `src/main/resources/application.properties`:
1. **H2 Database (Default, zero setup)**: Pre-configured to build, load tables, and run instantly out of the box with zero system setup! H2 Console is reachable at `/h2-console` with default username `sa` and empty password.
2. **PostgreSQL (Optional Production)**: Easily swappable by uncommenting database properties in the config file.

#### Commands:
```bash
# Build the Spring Boot JAR
gradle build

# Start the Spring Boot Application
gradle bootRun
```
